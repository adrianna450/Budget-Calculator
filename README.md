# Budget-Calculator
budget calculator built around the 50/30/20 investment rule
This calculator lets you enter your paycheck, after taxes, and gives you budgeting suggestions for saving on each check. The 50 in the rule is 50% of your pay check and should go toward your needs such as bills and grocerries. The 30 or 30% of your check goes toward things that you want, and 20% goes towards savings or a savings account.
